# FrozenMagisk

This version of Magisk should be used on Android devices using an old kernel like 3.4.113 and 3.18.140 to utilize addon.d inside TWRP and being able to enable Zygisk, furthermore these kernels should avoid using AdGuard Certificate module as it disables Zygisk.

# Alternative to AdGuard Certificate

Alternative is using module Move Certificates
